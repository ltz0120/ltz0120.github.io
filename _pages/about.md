I am a fourth year PhD student and luckily advised by the brilliant and kind researcher Prof. Sinno Jialin Pan. I am passionate about deep learning research in the following topics:

(1) Graph Representation Learning: Design graph representation learning methods and architectures for graph classification, edge prediction, generations, etc.


(2) Foundation Models: Stable Diffusion, GPT, they are seemingly promising to put AI with real intelligence into pratical use. I am also exploring foundation models for graph-structural data.
